Here you have found my first website design project!

This project includes some unique .hover point features in the css file which for example:

- Creates a red line animation under each subheading category
- Makes the central box icon turn red when hovering over it.

Please keep in mind that this project is always evolving and I would say is not reflective in my best work.
